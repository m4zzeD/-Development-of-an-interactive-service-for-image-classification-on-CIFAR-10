# Development of an interactive service for image classification on CIFAR-10
To develop an end-to-end solution for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in PyTorch and creating an interactive web application in Streamlit that allows users to upload images for classification.
